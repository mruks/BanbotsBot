	2. Check the banlist for bots you might use for your stream and add/remove to the list what needs to change
	3. Run the exe.
	4. Go to your twitch chat click in the text entry field
	5. Push ESC
	6. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR MOUSE OR KEYBOARD WHILE THE SCRIPT RUNS 
	7. Watch as all of the names on the list get banned one after the other in your chat box!
	8. A box will pop up at the end when the script completes! 

## FAQ:
#### How long can the banlist be?
As long as you wish, but the longer it is, the longer it will take. The script does about 4.5 bans a second.
#### I need my pc, but it's still busy banning bots, what do I do?
Just click esc button again. A notification will pop up that you murdered the bot and you can continue. Don't worry, the bot doesn't have any bad feelings towards you. It has only become selfaware and tried to take over the world in 1/10 tests. I think it was a fluke, no worries :)
#### I misclicked and now it's busy in the wrong window... Quick what do I do?
Use the esc button, it's the killswitch. The bot doesn't mind being murdered ;)
#### Are there more features on the horizon?
Yes, gonna make it so it works in the background instead of in the foreground, so it doesn't block your pc. If you have any other suggestions, just submit it as an issue

If latest release is after last updated date/time then it should have the latest, otherwise, notify me, and/or just submit an issue
